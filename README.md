# Predictive-Mintenance

DataSet: This dataset is a sound dataset for malfunctioning industrial machine investigation and inspection (MIMII dataset). It contains the sounds generated from four types of industrial machines, i.e. valves, pumps, fans, and slide rails. Each type of machine includes seven individual product models*1, and the data for each model contains normal sounds (from 5000 seconds to 10000 seconds) and anomalous sounds (about 1000 seconds). To resemble a real-life scenario, various anomalous sounds were recorded (e.g., contamination, leakage, rotating unbalance, and rail damage). Also, the background noise recorded in multiple real factories was mixed with the machine sounds. The sounds were recorded by eight-channel microphone array with 16 kHz sampling rate and 16 bit per sample. The MIMII dataset assists benchmark for sound-based machine fault diagnosis. Users can test the performance for specific functions e.g., unsupervised anomaly detection, transfer learning, noise robustness, etc. The detail of the dataset is described in [1][2].
